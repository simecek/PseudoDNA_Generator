# Fastai (v2) redesign

The original pivot was written in TF/keras. However, I have started rewriting the code to pytorch/fastai2. To get the benefit of GPU speed, I am mostly working with Google Colab and my code and data files live in my Google Drive folder. This is for sharing purposes / getting myself oriented.
