# PseudoDNA_Generator

This is an early prototype of a tool for generation pseudo-genomic sequences, i.e. DNA-like sequences that are hard to distinguish from DNA coming from a real genome. Currently, it uses LSTM to generate sequences that look like intergenomic regions but it can be easily adapted to generate any class of genomic sequences (e.g. protein coding genes).

As a side product, we created a pseudo-DNA classifier, i.e. a tool to distinguish real (genomic) sequences from unreal (permuted) sequences. Current accuracy on intergenomic regions is slightly higher than 80%.

**Jupyter Notebooks**:
  * `Random_Genome_Seqs.ipynb`: generate training sets, i.e. a random sequences from intergenomic regions
  * `PseudoDNA_LSTM_Generator.ipynb`: based on the first training set, generates sequences that look alike sequences from the training set 
  * `PseudoDNA_CNN_Classifier.ipynb`: based on the second training set, it learns to classify real genomic sequences vs. unreal (permuted) sequence
  * `Generator_Quality_Evaluation.ipynb`: quantify quality of LSTM generated sequences

**Data & Models**:
  * `random_seqs.csv`, `random_seqs2.csv`: first and the second training set generated by `Random_Genome_Seqs.ipynb`
  * `generated_seqs.csv`: a thousand sequences generated by `PseudoDNA_LSTM_Generator.ipynb`
  * `random_dna.loss*.h5`: model weights saved by `PseudoDNA_LSTM_Generator.ipynb`
  * `dna_classifier.loss*.h5`: model weights saved by `PseudoDNA_CNN_Classifier.ipynb`
